# NASA NPR 7150 Compliance matrix

[NASA NPR 7150.2D](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c=7150&s=2D)

- Section 3.1.2, SWE 33: The project manager shall assess options for software acquisition versus development.
  - Reuse of third-party open source dependencies

- Section 3.1.3, SWE 13: The project manager shall develop, maintain, and execute software plans, including security plans, that cover the entire software life cycle and, as a minimum, address the requirements of this directive with approved tailoring.
  - This document

- Section 3.1.10, SWE 42: The project manager shall require the software developer(s) to provide NASA with electronic access to the source code developed for the project in a modifiable format.
  - All source code is included in each release as a zip file attachment. Source code will also be distributed via GitHub.

- Section 3.1.11: SWE 139: The project manager shall comply with the requirements in this NPR that are marked with an “X” in Appendix C consistent with their software classification.
  - This document.

- Section 3.1.12: SWE 121: Where approved, the project manager shall document and reflect the tailored requirement in the plans or procedures controlling the development, acquisition, and deployment of the affected software.
  - No requirements tailored.

- Section 3.1.13, SWE 125: Each project manager with software components shall maintain a requirements mapping matrix or multiple requirements mapping matrices against requirements in this NPR, including those delegated to other parties or accomplished by contract vehicles or Space Act Agreements.
  - This document.

- Section 3.5.1, SWE 20: The project manager shall classify each system and subsystem containing software in accordance with the highest applicable software classification definitions for Classes A, B, C, D, E, and F software in Appendix D.
  - EIS Fire pilot scripts are Class E because they are not used to inform decisions for an operational NASA capability, and specifically include "software to explore correlations between datasets" and "file format converters".

- Section 3.5.2, SWE 176: The project manager shall maintain records of each software classification determination, each software Requirements Mapping Matrix, and the results of each software independent classification assessments for the life of the project.
  - This document.

- Section 3.6.1, SWE 22: The project manager shall plan and implement software assurance, software safety, and IV&V (if required) per NASA-STD-8739.8, Software Assurance and Software Safety Standard.
  - Automated security analysis ([CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)) is run automatically on all pushes pull requests to `main` branch using GitHub actions.

- Section 3.7.1, SWE 205: The project manager, in conjunction with the SMA organization, shall determine if each software component is considered to be safety-critical per the criteria defined in NASA-STD-8739.8.
  - Not safety critical software. This software is used only for downloading and transforming scientific data for research and development purposes.

- Section 3.10.2, SWE 148: The project manager shall evaluate software for potential reuse by other projects across NASA and contribute reuse candidates to the appropriate NASA internal sharing and reuse software system. However, if the project manager is not a civil servant, then a civil servant will pre-approve all such software contributions; all software contributions should include, at a minimum, the following information: a. Software Title. b. Software Description. c. The Civil Servant Software Technical POC for the software product. d. The language or languages used to develop the software. e. Any third party code contained therein and the record of the requisite license or permission received from the third party permitting the Government’s use and any required markings (e.g., required copyright, author, applicable license notices within the software code, and the source of each third-party software component (e.g., software URL & license URL)), if applicable. f. Release notes.
  - Open source release of software facilitates re-use. Contributors from across NASA were involved in the software development process to maximize the applicability of this software to similar datasets and analysis workflows.
